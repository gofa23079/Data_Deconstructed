# Data_Deconstructed
Hey, I’m Gofaone! 👋
Welcome to my data playground—where numbers meet curiosity, and spreadsheets tell stories. I’m a Business Intelligence and Data Analytics student and i live for turning raw data into insights that actually make sense (and look good doing it).


What You’ll Find Here
This portfolio is my little corner of the internet to showcase what I’ve been up to. You’ll find:

Data cleaning: Think of it as giving messy data a spa day.

Database design: Because organized data is happy data.

Visualizations: I turn numbers into something you can actually see and understand.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Finding the “aha!” moments hidden in the data.

Why I Love This Stuff

For me, data is more than just numbers. It’s stories, decisions, and possibilities all rolled into one. I love diving in, asking the right questions, and using data to help people see the bigger picture—or a smaller, more focused one when that’s what’s needed.

Let’s Chat!

I’m always looking for cool projects to sink my teeth into or fellow data enthusiasts to nerd out with. If you think we’d make a great team or just want to say hi, hit me up
